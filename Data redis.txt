we use jedis connectionfactory to connect with redis.
we also use redis template to interact with redis with help of jedis connection factory to store data.
Now store all data in a hashes and so on we have to create a hashes key. Here in my case i created Hash_key as key.
to save data into redis we use put method with help of redis template we created in begaining. for argument we need 
to pass hash key , key of the object and value of the object.
As redis unable to recognise java object for that we have to serialize the object by ourselves to make entity class 
implemented serializable
